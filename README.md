## About

awsm is a work-in-progress collection of crates for rust-powered wasm. The primary goal is 3d games, simulations, and other high-performance apps.

## Crates 

* [awsm_web](crates/web): The foundation for everything else
[CRATES.IO](https://crates.io/crates/awsm_web) - [DOCS](https://docs.rs/awsm_web)


* [awsm_renderer](crates/renderer) (r&d / pre-production):  a 3d renderer 
[CRATES.IO](https://crates.io/crates/awsm_renderer) - [DOCS](https://docs.rs/awsm_renderer)

## Live Coding 

As a way to self-motivate getting over the learning curve, I thought it might help to livestream the coding+learning sessions, and also archive them in a playlist for a look-back.
