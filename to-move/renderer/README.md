## About

awsm_renderer is a 3d renderer, intended to be used with other crates in the [awsm](https://github.com/dakom/awsm) ecosystem as well as with the [shipyard ECS](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard)

The renderering itself ~~blatently rips off~~ borrows _heavily_ from the official Khronos  [glTF-Sample-Viewer](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Viewer)

Transforms and other matrices use [nalgebra](https://www.nalgebra.org/)
