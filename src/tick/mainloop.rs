/// A Rust port of https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js
///
/// It's pretty much a direct port, except for two differences:
/// 1. it all runs in one loop with a branch (probably cheaper than passing the required Rc/RefCells around)
/// 2. starting/stopping is explicit via cancelling and restarting (there is no reset_frame_delta() or runtime fps cap)
///
///
/// @begin: A function that runs at the beginning of the main loop.
///  
/// The begin() function is typically used to process input before the
/// updates run. Processing input here (in chunks) can reduce the running
/// time of event handlers, which is useful because long-running event
/// handlers can sometimes delay frames.
///
/// Unlike update(), which can run zero or more times per
/// frame, begin() always runs exactly once per frame. This makes it useful
/// for any updates that are not dependent on time in the simulation.
/// Examples include adjusting HUD calculations or performing long-running
/// updates incrementally. Compared to end(), generally
/// actions should occur in begin() if they affect anything that
/// update() or draw() use
///
/// * timestamp
///
///   The current timestamp (when the frame started), in milliseconds. This
///   should only be used for comparison to other timestamps because the
///   epoch (i.e. the "zero" time) depends on the engine running this code.
///   In engines that support `DOMHighResTimeStamp` (all modern browsers
///   except iOS Safari 8) the epoch is the time the page started loading,
///   specifically `performance.timing.navigationStart`. Everywhere else,
///   including node.js, the epoch is the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
///
/// * delta
///
///   The total elapsed time that has not yet been simulated, in
///   milliseconds.
///
/// @update: The function that runs updates (e.g. AI and physics).
///
/// The update() function should simulate anything that is affected by time.
/// It can be called zero or more times per frame depending on the frame
/// rate.
///
/// As with everything in the main loop, the running time of update()
/// directly affects the frame rate. If update() takes long enough that the
/// frame rate drops below the target ("budgeted") frame rate, parts of the
/// update() function that do not need to execute between every frame can be
/// moved into Web Workers. (Various sources on the internet sometimes
/// suggest other scheduling patterns using setTimeout() or setInterval().
/// These approaches sometimes offer modest improvements with minimal
/// changes to existing code, but because JavaScript is single-threaded, the
/// updates will still block rendering and drag down the frame rate. Web
/// Workers execute in separate threads, so they free up more time in the
/// main loop.)
///
/// This script can be imported into a Web Worker using importScripts() and
/// used to run a second main loop in the worker. Some considerations:
///
/// - Profile your code before doing the work to move it into Web Workers.
///   It could be the rendering that is the bottleneck, in which case the
///   solution is to decrease the visual complexity of the scene.
/// - It doesn't make sense to move the *entire* contents of update() into
///   workers unless draw() can interpolate between frames.
///   The lowest-hanging fruit is background updates (like calculating
///   citizens' happiness in a city-building game), physics that doesn't
///   affect the scene (like flags waving in the wind), and anything that is
///   occluded or happening far off screen.
/// - If draw() needs to interpolate physics based on activity that occurs
///   in a worker, the worker needs to pass the interpolation value back to
///   the main thread so that is is available to draw().
/// - Web Workers can't access the state of the main thread, so they can't
///   directly modify objects in your scene. Moving data to and from Web
///   Workers is a pain. The fastest way to do it is with Transferable
///   Objects: basically, you can pass an ArrayBuffer to a worker,
///   destroying the original reference in the process.
///
/// You can read more about Web Workers and Transferable Objects at
/// [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/).
///
/// * delta
///
///   The amount of time in milliseconds to simulate in the update. In most
///   cases this timestep never changes in order to ensure deterministic
///   updates. The timestep is the same as that returned by
///   `MainLoop.getSimulationTimestep()`.
///
/// @draw: A function that draws things on the screen.
///
/// The draw() function gets passed the percent of time that the next run of
/// update() will simulate that has actually elapsed, as
/// a decimal. In other words, draw() gets passed how far between update()
/// calls it is. This is useful because the time simulated by update() and
/// the time between draw() calls is usually different, so the parameter to
/// draw() can be used to interpolate motion between frames to make
/// rendering appear smoother. To illustrate, if update() advances the
/// simulation at each vertical bar in the first row below, and draw() calls
/// happen at each vertical bar in the second row below, then some frames
/// will have time left over that is not yet simulated by update() when
/// rendering occurs in draw():
///
/// update() timesteps:  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
/// draw() calls:        |   |   |   |   |   |   |
///
/// To interpolate motion for rendering purposes, objects' state after the
/// last update() must be retained and used to calculate an intermediate
/// state. Note that this means renders will be up to one update() behind.
/// This is still better than extrapolating (projecting objects' state after
/// a future update()) which can produce bizarre results. Storing multiple
/// states can be difficult to set up, and keep in mind that running this
/// process takes time that could push the frame rate down, so it's often
/// not worthwhile unless stuttering is visible.
///
/// * interpolation_percentage
///
///   The cumulative amount of time that hasn't been simulated yet, divided
///   by the amount of time that will be simulated the next time update()
///   runs. Useful for interpolating frames.
///
/// @end: A function that runs at the end of the main loop.
///
/// Unlike update(), which can run zero or more times per
/// frame, end() always runs exactly once per frame. This makes it useful
/// for any updates that are not dependent on time in the simulation.
/// Examples include cleaning up any temporary state set up by
/// begin(), lowering the visual quality if the frame rate
/// is too low, or performing long-running updates incrementally. Compared
/// to begin(), generally actions should occur in end() if they use anything
/// that update() or draw() affect.
///
/// * fps
///
///   The exponential moving average of the frames per second. It can be used
///   to take action when the FPS is too low (or to restore to normalcy if the FPS
///   moves back up). Examples of actions to take if the FPS is too low
///   include exiting the application, lowering the visual quality, stopping
///   or reducing activities outside of the main loop like event handlers or
///   audio playback, performing non-critical updates less frequently, or
///   restarting with a higher simulation timestep.  Note that this last option
///   results in more time being simulated per update() call, which causes
///   the application to behave non-deterministically.
///
/// * end_panic
///
///   Indicates whether the simulation has fallen too far behind real time.
///   Specifically, `panic` will be `true` if too many updates occurred in
///   one frame. In networked lockstep applications, the application should
///   wait for some amount of time to see if the user can catch up before
///   dropping the user. In networked but non-lockstep applications, this
///   typically indicates that the user needs to be snapped or eased to the
///   current authoritative state. When this happens, it may be convenient
///   to call `MainLoop.resetFrameDelta()` to discard accumulated pending
///   updates. In non-networked applications, it may be acceptable to allow
///   the application to keep running for awhile to see if it will catch up.
///   However, this could also cause the application to look like it is
///   running very quickly for a few frames as it transitions through the
///   intermediate states. If the application panics
///   frequently, this is an indication that the main loop is running too
///   slowly. However, most of the time the drop in frame rate will probably
///   be noticeable before a panic occurs. To help the application catch up
///   after a panic caused by a spiral of death, the same steps can be taken
///   that are suggested above if the FPS drops too low.

             * A naive way to move an object along its X-axis might be to write a main
             * loop containing the statement `obj.x += 10;` which would move the object
             * 10 units per frame. This approach suffers from the issue that it is
             * dependent on the frame rate. In other words, if your application is
             * running slowly (that is, fewer frames per second), your object will also
             * appear to move slowly, whereas if your application is running quickly
             * (that is, more frames per second), your object will appear to move
             * quickly. This is undesirable, especially in multiplayer/multi-user
             * applications.
             *
             * One solution is to multiply the speed by the amount of time that has
             * passed between rendering frames. For example, if you want your object to
             * move 600 units per second, you might write `obj.x += 600 * delta`, where
             * `delta` is the time passed since the last frame. (For convenience, let's
             * move this statement to an update() function that takes `delta` as a
             * parameter.) This way, your object will move a constant distance over
             * time. However, at low frame rates and high speeds, your object will move
             * large distances every frame, which can cause it to do strange things
             * such as move through walls. Additionally, we would like our program to
             * be deterministic. That is, every time we run the application with the
             * same input, we would like exactly the same output. If the time between
             * frames (the `delta`) varies, our output will diverge the longer the
             * program runs due to accumulated rounding errors, even at normal frame
             * rates.
             *
             * A better solution is to separate the amount of time simulated in each
             * update() from the amount of time between frames. Our update() function
             * doesn't need to change; we just need to change the delta we pass to it
             * so that each update() simulates a fixed amount of time (that is, `delta`
             * should have the same value each time update() is called). The update()
             * function can be run multiple times per frame if needed to simulate the
             * total amount of time passed since the last frame. (If the time that has
             * passed since the last frame is less than the fixed simulation time, we
             * just won't run an update() until the the next frame. If there is
             * unsimulated time left over that is less than our timestep, we'll just
             * leave it to be simulated during the next frame.) This approach avoids
             * inconsistent rounding errors and ensures that there are no giant leaps
             * through walls between frames.
             *
             * That is what is done below. It introduces a new problem, but it is a
             * manageable one: if the amount of time spent simulating is consistently
             * longer than the amount of time between frames, the application could
             * freeze and crash in a spiral of death. This won't happen as long as the
             * fixed simulation time is set to a value that is high enough that
             * update() calls usually take less time than the amount of time they're
             * simulating. If it does start to happen anyway, see `MainLoop.setEnd()`
             * for a discussion of ways to stop it.
